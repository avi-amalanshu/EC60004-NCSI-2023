# EC60004 Spring 2023
This repo contains code and reports for projects from the course on [Neuronal Coding of Sensory Information (EC60004)](https://informationprocessinglab.weebly.com/ec60004-ncsi.html) offered by the E&ECE department at IIT KGP. In particular, this is relevant to the Spring 2023 iteration of the course, which was instructed by [Prof. Sharba Bandyopadhyay](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC/faculty/ec-sharba).
There were broadly two projects:
* One on cat auditory nerve fiber responses to tones and speech (a MATLAB programming exercise based on an existing model)
* Another on writing a proposal for an in-depth research project related to the subject matter of the course.

All the material relating to both projects are present in this repository.
* ```project_ncsi_23``` contains the problem statement for the cat ANF project
* ```Avi_Proj_20EC30063.m``` produces all the requried plots for the cat ANF project
* ```20EC30063_Report.pdf``` contains a cogent write-up summarizing the results for the cat ANF project
* ```NCSIProposal.pdf``` contains my proposal.
	* The proposal is titled "Exploring Texture Discrimination in Non-Human Primates through Analysis of Neural Responses to Filtered Visual Stimuli". 
	* The general idea is to present a monkey with various filtered images and analyze which parts of the brain are activated by texture, and which of the filters cause the strongest activation. Although I didn't discuss it in my report, perhaps presenting the monkey with plain colors with different textures (say a white towel and a whiteboard) and performing the same analysis.

All credit to Prof. Sharba and his TAs for the problem statements.
